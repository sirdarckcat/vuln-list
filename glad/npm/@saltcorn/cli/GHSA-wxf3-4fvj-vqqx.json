  "Description": "### Summary\nUnsafe plugins (for instance `sql-list`) can be installed in subdomain tenants via pack import even if unsafe plugin installation for tenants is disables\n\n### Details\nI have an example\nhttps://bot20230704.saltcorn.com/view/all_plugins\nIt's publicly accessible (but has not so secure values except list of tenants).\nBut using this mech one can read **any** data from other tenants.\n\n### Impact\nAll tenants of installation (i.e. `saltcorn.com`), can be compromised from tenant user has admin access. If an untrusted user has admin rights to a tenant instance, they will be able to install a plug-in that can access information from other tenants",
