  "Title": "Improper use of metav1.Duration allows for Denial of Service",
  "Description": "Flux controllers within the affected versions range is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. Users that have permissions to change Fluxâ€™s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed.\nThe issue has two root causes a) the Kubernetes type `metav1.Duration` not being fully compatible with the Go type `time.Duration` as explained on [upstream report](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131); b) lack of validation within Flux to restrict allowed values.",
