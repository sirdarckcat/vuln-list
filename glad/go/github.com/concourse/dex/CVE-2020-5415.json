  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/concourse/dex",
  "Title": "GitLab auth uses full name instead of username as user ID, allowing impersonation",
  "Description": "Installations which use the GitLab auth connector are vulnerable to identity spoofing by way of configuring a GitLab account with the same full name as another GitLab user who is granted access to a Concourse team by having their full name listed under `users` in the team configuration or given to the `--gitlab-user` flag.\n\nSee the [GitLab auth docs](https://concourse-ci.org/gitlab-auth.html) for details.\n\nConcourse installations which do not configure the GitLab auth connector are not affected.",
