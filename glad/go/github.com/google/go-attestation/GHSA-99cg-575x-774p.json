  "Title": "Improper Input Validation in AKPublic.Verify with attacker-controlled TPM Quote",
  "Description": "An improper input validation vulnerability in go-attestation allows local users to provide a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs, causing `AKPublic.Verify` to succeed despite the inconsistency. Subsequent use of the same set of PCR values in `Eventlog.Verify` lacks the authentication performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker could couple this vulnerability with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in `Eventlog.Verify` to spoof events in the TCG log, hence defeating remotely-attested measured-boot.",
