  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-23685",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/org.folio/mod-remote-storage",
  "Title": "Hard-coded System User Credentials in Folio Data Export Spring module ",
  "Description": "The module creates a system user that is used to perform internal module-to-module operations.  Credentials for this user are hard-coded in the source code.  This makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, allowing unauthorized read access to these mod-inventory-storage records: instances, holdings, items, contributor-types, identifier-types. This includes records marked as suppressed from discovery.",
