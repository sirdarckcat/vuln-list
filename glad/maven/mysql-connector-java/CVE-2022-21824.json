  "Identifier": "CVE-2022-21824",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/mysql-connector-java",
  "Title": "Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')",
  "Description": "Due to the formatting logic of the \"console.table()\" function it was not safe to allow user controlled input to be passed to the \"properties\" parameter while simultaneously passing a plain object with at least one property as the first parameter, which could be \"__proto__\". The prototype pollution has very limited control, in that it only allows an empty string to be assigned to numerical keys of the object prototype.Node.js \u003e= 12.22.9, \u003e= 14.18.3, \u003e= 16.13.2, and \u003e= 17.3.1 use a null protoype for the object these properties are being assigned to.",
