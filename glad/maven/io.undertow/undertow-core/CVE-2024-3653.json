  "Identifier": "CVE-2024-3653",
  "PackageSlug": "maven/io.undertow/undertow-core",
  "Title": "Undertow Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability",
  "Description": "A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling the learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default, leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server with a normal HTTP request.",
