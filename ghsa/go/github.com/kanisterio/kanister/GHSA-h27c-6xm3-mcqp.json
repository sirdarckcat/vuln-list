    "Description": "### Details\nThe kanister has a deployment called default-kanister-operator, which is bound with a ClusterRole called edit via ClusterRoleBinding(https://github.com/kanisterio/kanister/blob/master/helm/kanister-operator/templates/rbac.yaml#L49). The \"edit\" ClusterRole is one of Kubernetes default-created ClusterRole, and it have create/patch/udpate verbs of daemonset resources, create verb of serviceaccount/token resources, and impersonate verb of serviceaccounts resources. If a malicious user can access the worker node which has this component, he/she can:\n\nFor the create/patch/update verbs of daemonset resources, the malicious user can abuse it to create or modify a set of Pods to mount a high-privilege service account (e.g., the cluster-admin service account). After that, he/she can abuse the high-privilege SA token of created Pod to take over the whole cluster.\n\nFor the create verb of serviceaccount/token resources, a malicious user can abuse this permission to generate new Service Account tokens and use them to operate with high-privilege roles, such as cluster administrators. These tokens can be used to access and manipulate any resources within the cluster.\n\nFor the impersonate verb of serviceaccounts resources, a malicious user can impersonate high-privilege Service Accounts, thereby gaining access to roles such as cluster administrators. This enables the attacker to perform all actions that the high-privilege account can, including creating, modifying, and deleting critical resources within the cluster.\n\n\n### PoC\nWe have discussed in the \"Details\" section\n\n### Impact\nPrivilege escalation\n",
