    "Description": "### Impact\nThe CIRCL implementation of FourQ fails to validate user-supplied low-order points during Diffie-Hellman key exchange, potentially allowing attackers to force the identity point and compromise session security.\n\nMoreover, there is an incorrect point validation in ScalarMult can lead to incorrect results in the isEqual function and if a point is on the curve.\n\n\n### Patches\nVersion 1.6.1 (https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/tree/v1.6.1) mitigates the identified issues.\n\nWe acknowledge Alon Livne (Botanica Software Labs) for the reported findings.",
