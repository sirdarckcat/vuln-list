    "Description": "### Impact\nThe Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, serversâ€™ addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users.\n\nThis vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. \n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds.\n",
