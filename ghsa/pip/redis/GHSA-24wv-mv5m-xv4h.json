    "Description": "redis-py before 4.5.3, as used in ChatGPT and other products, leaves a connection open after canceling an async Redis command at an inopportune time (in the case of a pipeline operation), and can send response data to the client of an unrelated request in an off-by-one manner. The fixed versions for this CVE Record are 4.3.6, 4.4.3, and 4.5.3, but [are believed to be incomplete](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/issues/2665). CVE-2023-28859 has been assigned the issues caused by the incomplete fixes.",
