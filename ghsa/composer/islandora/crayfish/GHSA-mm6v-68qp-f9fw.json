    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nRemote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nThe issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nThe exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus.\n\nConfigure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n- XBOW-024-071",
