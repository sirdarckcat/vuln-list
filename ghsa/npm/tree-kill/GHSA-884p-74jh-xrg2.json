    "Description": "Versions of `tree-kill` prior to 1.2.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize values passed to the  `kill` function. If this value is user-controlled it  may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the server. The issue only affects Windows systems.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.2.2 or later.",
