    "Description": "The `pandora-doomsday` package is a malicious package that adds itself to the package.json of other packages discovered on the victim host and attempts to publish the package. \n\nIt has been removed from the npm registry.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAny computer that has this package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.",
