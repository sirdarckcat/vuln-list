    "Description": "### Description\n\nThe Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored XSS.\n\n### Impact\n\nSince the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact.\n\nHowever, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\n### Workarounds\nNone, other than not using the Export Chat feature.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n",
