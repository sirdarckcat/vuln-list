    "Description": "Affected versions of `summit` allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands via collection names when using the `PouchDB` driver.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo direct patch is available at this time.\n\nCurrently, the best option to mitigate the issue is to avoid using the `PouchDB` driver, as the package author has abandoned this feature entirely.",
