    "Description": "A security problem involving peer certificate verification was found where failed verification silently did nothing, making affected applications vulnerable to attackers. Attackers could lead a client application to believe that a secure connection to a rogue SSL server is legitimate. Attackers could also penetrate client-validated SSL server applications with a dummy certificate.\n",
