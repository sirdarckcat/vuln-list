  "summary": "New authd users logging in via SSH are members of the root group",
  "details": "### Impact\nWhen a user who hasn't logged in to the system before (i.e. doesn't exist in the authd user database) logs in via SSH, the user is considered a member of the root group in the context of the SSH session. That leads to a local privilege escalation if the user should not have root privileges.\n\n### Patches\nFixed by https://github.com/ubuntu/authd/commit/619ce8e55953b970f1765ddaad565081538151ab\n\n### Workarounds\nConfigure the SSH server to not allow authenticating via authd, for example by setting `UsePAM no` or `KbdInteractiveAuthentication no` in the `sshd_config` (see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/authd/stable/howto/login-ssh/#ssh-configuration).",
