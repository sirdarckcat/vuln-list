  "summary": "SyncChannel\u003cT\u003e can move 'T: !Send' to other threads",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `SyncChannel\u003cT\u003e`.\n`SyncChannel\u003cT\u003e` doesn't provide access to `\u0026T` but merely serves as a channel that consumes and returns owned `T`.\n\nUsers can create UB in safe Rust by sending `T: !Send` to other threads with `SyncChannel::send/recv` APIs. Using `T = Arc\u003cCell\u003c_\u003e` allows to create data races (which can lead to memory corruption), and using `T = MutexGuard\u003cT\u003e` allows to unlock a mutex from a thread that didn't lock the mutex.",
