  ],
  "summary": "Data race in conqueue",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send`/`Sync` for `QueueSender\u003cT\u003e`,\nallowing to send non-Send `T` to other threads by invoking `(\u0026QueueSender\u003cT\u003e).send()`.\n\nThis fails to prevent users from creating data races by sending types like `Rc\u003cT\u003e` or `Arc\u003cCell\u003cT\u003e\u003e` to other threads, which can lead to memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit 1e462c3 by imposing `T: Send` to both `Send`/`Sync` impls for `QueueSender\u003cT\u003e`/`QueueReceiver\u003cT\u003e`.",
