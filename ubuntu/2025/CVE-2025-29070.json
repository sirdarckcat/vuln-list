  "Description": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability has been identified in thesmooth2() in cmsgamma.c in lcms2-2.16 which allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. NOTE: the Supplier disputes this because \"this is not exploitable as this function is never called on normal color management, is there only as a helper for low-level programming and investigation.\"",
