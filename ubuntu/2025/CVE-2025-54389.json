  "Description": "Rajesh Pangare discovered an improper output neutralization vulnerability in AIDE, an advanced intrusion detection system. An attacker can craft a malicious filename by including terminal escape sequences to hide the addition or removal of the file from the report and/or tamper with the log output. A local user might exploit this to bypass the AIDE detection of malicious files. Additionally the output of extended attribute key names and symbolic links targets are also not properly neutralized.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Rajesh Pangare discovered that AIDE incorrectly handled filenames. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass detection of mailicious files.",
