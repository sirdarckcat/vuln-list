  "Description": "LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser integration of LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme 'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to LibreOffice was added. In the affected versions of LibreOffice a link in a browser using that scheme could be constructed with an embedded inner URL that when passed to LibreOffice could call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. This issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.8 before \u003c 24.8.5, from 25.2 before \u003c 25.2.1.",
