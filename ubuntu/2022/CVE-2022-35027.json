  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "sbeattie\u003e debian claims oftccdump is not built in texlive-bin, which is technically correct and thus not affected; however, the underlying oftcc source files get compiled into the mflua binary, and it's not clear from all these reports whether or not it is affected by these fuzzing findings."
