  "Description": "A flaw was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's paravirtual RDMA device. This flaw allows a crafted guest driver to allocate and initialize a huge number of page tables to be used as a ring of descriptors for CQ and async events, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read and crash of QEMU.",
