  "Notes": [
    "alexmurray\u003e As of 2023-11-15 there doesn't appear to be an official microcode update within the upstream linux-firmware repository although https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/commit/?id=06afd7f939c5b245b2af9e0fee13026f2aaf77fa looks suspiciously likely as it is the only recent commit for the microcode for 3rd generation EPYC processors which are the ones listed as affected by the upstream advisory"
