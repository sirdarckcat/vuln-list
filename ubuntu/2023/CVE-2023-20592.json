  "Notes": [
    "alexmurray\u003e As of 2023-11-15 there doesn't appear to be an official microcode update within the upstream linux-firmware repository although commit 06afd7f939c5b245b2af9e0fee13026f2aaf77fa looks suspiciously likely as it is the only recent commit for the microcode for 3rd generation EPYC processors which are the ones listed as affected by the upstream advisory. The upstream advisory AMD-SB-3005 mentions microcode revisions that were contained in the older commit b250b32ab1d044953af2dc5e790819a7703b7ee6 which was provided via USN-6319-1 so it is not clear what the official fix is for this at this time."
