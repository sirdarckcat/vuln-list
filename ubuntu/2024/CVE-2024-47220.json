  "Description": "An issue was discovered in the WEBrick toolkit through 1.8.1 for Ruby. It allows HTTP request smuggling by providing both a Content-Length header and a Transfer-Encoding header, e.g., \"GET /admin HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" inside of a \"POST /user HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" request. NOTE: the supplier's position is \"Webrick should not be used in production.\"",
