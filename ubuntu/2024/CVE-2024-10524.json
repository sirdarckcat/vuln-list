  "Description": "It has been discovered that when using the HTTP shorthand format with user-provided input, unexpected behavior may occur. Wget might issue an FTP request to a different host - a potentially attacker-controlled host or a restricted host which the user normally does not have access to. This SSRF vulnerability can be the starting point for many types of attacks.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e the upstream fix removes shorthand support for URLs. Fixing this",
    "mdeslaur\u003e will change behaviour and may break existing uses of wget."
