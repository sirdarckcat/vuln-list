  "Description": "decNumberCopy in decNumber.c in jq through 1.7.1 does not properly consider that NaN is interpreted as numeric, which has a resultant stack-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds write, as demonstrated by use of --slurp with subtraction, such as a filter of .-. when the input has a certain form of digit string with NaN (e.g., \"1 NaN123\" immediately followed by many more digits).",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "mdeslaur\u003e A stack overflow in a command line tool is a DoS only",
    "mdeslaur\u003e Reproducer required AddressSanitizer, could not reproduce DoS in",
    "mdeslaur\u003e stable Ubuntu releases."
